# Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security

    Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools
    Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection
    Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection)
    Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2)
